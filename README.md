## maxMirror
[CodingBat](https://app.codility.com/programmers/) is a free site of live Java and Python coding problems to build coding skill.

This repo contains my solution for the problem [‘maxMirror’](https://codingbat.com/prob/p196409) in **Java > Array-3**, written in **Java** language.

I used the bottom-up approach/Dynamic Programming solution to solve this problem. This is usually used to solve the **'Longest Common Substring (LCS)'** problem.
I found that the maxMirror problem is a special case of the 'LCS' problem when the two strings are reflections of each other.
